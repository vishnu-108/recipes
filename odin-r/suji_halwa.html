    <h4 class="subhead"> Description </h4>
    <p class="des">Suji ka halwa is your classic everyday delicious North Indian sweet made with fine semolina or cream of wheat (farina), sugar, ghee, nuts and flavored with cardamom powder. In Maharashtra, this sweet is called as Sheera. Semolina is called as suji, sooji or rava. This easy melt-in-the-mouth halwa recipe comes together in about 15 minutes. The recipe I share is a family heirloom recipe that we have been making for decades during family get-togethers, special occasions and festivals.</p>
    <p class="des">Suji halwa is also known as Rava Sheera in Western India and Rava Kesari in South India. The method of preparation is more or less similar, with a few ingredients being changed here and there.</p>
    <h4 class="subhead">Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
     <li>The ratio of suji to sugar to water to ghee is 1:1:2:0.5 in a cup or glass measurement.
     <li>Sugar –  For 1 cup of sooji or rava, I add ⅔ or ¾ cup of sugar. So the suji halwa has less sweetness or is just sweet.</li>
     <li>Ghee – I also add ⅔ cup ghee for 1 cup of suji. For me, ⅔ cup is a good amount of ghee. Reduce or increase the ghee if you prefer.</li>  
     <li>Water – I add 2.5 cups water for 1 cup of suji. Though you can even add 2 cups of water. The amount of water can also be increased depending on the quality of the rava and if you want a pudding-like smooth consistency.</li>
    </ul>
    <h4 class="subhead">Steps</h4>
    <ol>
     <li>Heat ⅓ cup ghee in a kadai or a thick bottomed pan. Keep the heat to a low or medium-low. Use a heavy pan or else there is a risk of the suji getting burnt.</li>
     <li>When the ghee is getting heated, at the same time keep sugar and water to boil in a pan on a different burner. Steps are mentioned below under the heading “Making sugar solution for halwa“</li>
     <li> Add ½ cup sooji (rava or semolina). Use a fine variety of sooji and not the coarser variety.</li>
     <li> Also add 10 to 12 cashews halved or whole.</li>
     <li>Mix very well and start roasting the sooji and cashews.</li>
     <li> Keep on stirring the sooji so that the grains do not stick to the pan and are roasted evenly</li>
     <li>Roast sooji till you can see the ghee getting separated and when you see the cashews getting golden. The color of the suji or rava should not become brown. There will also be a fragrant aroma of suji and ghee in your kitchen.</li>
     <li>When the suji is fried well, then add 1 teaspoon chironji (optional), 2 tablespoons golden raisins (kishmish) and a pinch of edible camphor (optional).</li>
     <li>When you keep the sooji for roasting in the ghee, at the same time, take ⅓ cup sugar in another pan or saucepan.</li>
     <li>Keep the pan on a stovetop on medium-low to medium heat. With a spoon stir so that the sugar dissolves.</li>
     <li>Once you stir the raisins, cardamom powder and chironji, then pour the boiling and bubbling sugar solution in the ghee-sooji mixture slowly, with continuous stirring. Pour carefully, as the mixture sizzles and splutters.</li>
     <li>Keep stirring and cooking till you get the final texture of the rava sheera like the below picture. All the water should be absorbed and the halwa will leave the sides of the pan.</li>
